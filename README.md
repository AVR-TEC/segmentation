# Segmentation

This repository contains tensorflow implemenation of two models for semantic segmentations known to give high accuracy:

* **U-net** (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) : The network can be found in [u_net.py](./unet.py)

* **FCN** with **global convolution network** : (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02719) :
